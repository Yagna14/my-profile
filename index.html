	 			<h2> ✈︎ TRAVELLING </h2>

	 			<p> I have a profound passion for travelling and discovering new cultures. My journey began with a visit to Rodrigues Island, followed by an educational trip to China. During my bachelor's degree, I embraced the opportunity to study abroad; my first year in France, my second in Singapore, and my third in England for an exchange year. Besides academic travels, I also travel for leisure, enjoying unforgettable experiences in countries like Spain and Italy. Each destination has enriched my understanding of the world and deepened my appreciation for its diverse cultures.</p>

	 			<h2> SWIMMING </h2> 

	 			<p>Swimming has been a beloved hobby of mine since I was 12. There's something about being in the water that feels natural and peaceful to me. It's where I find freedom and calmness, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Swimming isn't just about staying in shape; it's my go-to retreat for clearing my mind and recharging.</p>

	 			<h2> PILATES </h2>

	 			<p>Pilates is one of my top hobbies for its unmatched convenience. With no need for a gym or fancy equipment, I can practice anywhere, anytime, with just a mat and comfy clothes. Whether solo or in a group, Pilates fits my lifestyle perfectly. It's a lifelong passion offering endless variety and challenges, ensuring I stay engaged and inspired for years to come. </p>
